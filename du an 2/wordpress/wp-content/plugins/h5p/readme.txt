Create and add rich content to your website for free. Some examples of what you get with H5P are Interactive Video, Quizzes, Collage and Timeline.

== Description ==

One of the great benefits with using H5P is that it gives you access to lots of different [interactive content types](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications "Examples and Downloads").

Another great benefit with H5P is that it allows you to easily share and reuse content. To use content created with H5P, you simply insert a shortcode `[h5p Id="1"]` where you wish for the content to appear. To reuse content, you just download the H5P you would like to edit and make your changes – e.g. translate to a new language or adjust it to a new situation.

H5P is:

* Open Source
* Free to Use
* HTML5
* Responsive

The H5P community is actively contributing to improve H5P. Updates and new features are continuously made available on the community portal [H5P.org](https://h5p.org "H5P").
